      Hey there! My name is Nick Nolan. I am 31 years old and live in Roswell, GA. I am married to my lovely wife, Elizabeth, of 6 years as of this March. We have two children, Theo and Beckett. Theo is 4 years old, and Beckett is 2 years old as of this past Christmas. Yes, he is a Christmas baby. Fun fact about that date: December 25th is the second least common birthday in the United States, second only to leap day.

        We moved to Roswell, GA 2 years ago. We live in a house right near the Chattahoochee river off Riverside Rd. This is a great area for some of my favorite outdoor activities. I enjoy going for runs along the river, mountain biking, road biking, kayaking, and disc golf (frolf!). We also live very close to the Chattahoochee Nature Center, where we take our two kids every couple of weeks or so.

        I graduated from the University of Georgia with a degree in Risk Management and Insurance in 2009. Since then, I have worked in a few different companies including Hanover Insurance, Colibrium, Definition 6, and a short stint at a startup called HubLogix. Overtime, I realized my affinity for development, which I plan to pivot into once this class is complete.
